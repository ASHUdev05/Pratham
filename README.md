# Initial setup on 16th of June 2022

> What is this?

* PRATHAM - A compiled language which is still being developed with the aim of becoming a easy to use but powerful language. 

> Origin of PRATHAM

* The project was started by me "ASHUTOSH KUMAR JHA". Any contributors will be given credit!

Being developed with ❤️ in 🇮🇳 .

> Why PRATHAM?

    * Ever thought Python is easy to use but is slow and is not really suitable for the competitive programming?
    * C++ is a great choice but is hard to learn?
    * JAVA is good to go but is verbose?
* PRATHAM is being developed with this in mind. It will be easy to use like python but will not yell at you everytime you miss a semicolon or mix up tabs and spaces.

> Why is it open source?

* Good things are always available for everyone. jk, I dont trust my code so better people look inside what they are gonna use, just in case uk.

> How can I use it now?

* Though its in very early stages, you can use it by cloning the repo, then install gcc and make.Edit `main.c` file accordingly and run below commands.

```
$ sudo make install
$ pratham
```
* For now the makefile is only for UNIX systems(commonly all linux based distros). You can easily uninstall it by running `make uninstall`.

```
$ sudo make unistall
```

> How can I contribute?

* Oh boy you want to contribute? Thanks it will help a lot. You can contribute by creating a pull request. Its that easy ;) except for implementing the features :(
